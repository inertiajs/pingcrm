[Ignition](https://flareapp.io/docs/ignition-for-laravel/introduction) is a beautiful and customizable error page for Laravel applications. It is the default error page for new Laravel applications. It also allows to publicly share your errors on [Flare](https://flareapp.io). If configured with a valid Flare API key, your errors in production applications will be tracked, and you'll get notified when they happen.

`spatie/laravel-ignition` works for Laravel 8 and 9 applications running on PHP 8.0 and above. Looking for Ignition for Laravel 5.x, 6.x or 7.x or old PHP versions? `facade/ignition` is still compatible.

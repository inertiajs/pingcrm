This repository contains the PHP client to send errors and exceptions to [Flare](https://flareapp.io). The client can be installed using composer and works for PHP 8.0 and above.

Using Laravel? You probably want to use [Ignition for Laravel](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-ignition). It comes with a beautiful error page and has the Flare client built in.
